For this exercise we provide one CSV file that contains the type of data you would normally come across on the job.  It isn’t necessary to understand the meaning behind the data to complete the exercise.

Use whatever language and framework(s) you find familiar and appropriate for the task. 

All of your results should be made available in another file called FILE B.

Write a script that will extract and list Jill, Candice, and Alycia’s items and create a column for total cost.  
Write a script that can be scheduled to update the CSV to change all FavoriteFridge1 to FavoriteFridge2 at 11pm on Sunday 12 January 2019.
